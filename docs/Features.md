Certainly! Hereâ€™s a detailed table that explains the features related to Large Language Models (LLMs) for Language Programming QA, Code Summary, Code Explanation, and Code Suggestion. The table includes information about usage, description, dataset type, evaluation methods, and provides examples in ShareGPT format for instruction-based datasets and Alpaca format for pretrain-based datasets.

| **Language Programming QA** | Answering programming-related questions | Provides specific answers to questions about programming tasks or concepts | Instruction-based    | Accuracy, relevance, completeness, BLEU | **Instruction-Based (ShareGPT)**: <br> **Prompt**: "How do I reverse a string in Python?" <br> **Response**: "You can reverse a string in Python using slicing: `reversed_string = original_string[::-1]`." | **Pretrain-Based (Alpaca)**: <br> **Prompt**: "How do you reverse a string in Python?" <br> **Completion**: "You can reverse a string in Python using slicing: `reversed_string = original_string[::-1]`."                         |
| **Code Summary**      | Summarizing code functionality             | Provides a concise summary of what a piece of code does   | Instruction-based    | Coherence, accuracy, brevity, BERTScore  | **Instruction-Based (ShareGPT)**: <br> **Prompt**: "Summarize the following Python code: `for i in range(5): print(i)`." <br> **Response**: "This code prints numbers from 0 to 4, each on a new line." | **Pretrain-Based (Alpaca)**: <br> **Prompt**: "Summarize the following code: `for i in range(5): print(i)`." <br> **Completion**: "The code prints integers from 0 to 4, each on a new line."                               |
| **Code Explanation**  | Explaining code logic                     | Provides a detailed explanation of what a piece of code does | Instruction-based    | Clarity, accuracy, completeness, ROUGE  | **Instruction-Based (ShareGPT)**: <br> **Prompt**: "Explain this Python code: `def add(a, b): return a + b`." <br> **Response**: "This function `add` takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns their sum." | **Pretrain-Based (Alpaca)**: <br> **Prompt**: "Explain the following code: `def add(a, b): return a + b`." <br> **Completion**: "The function `add` takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum."                                     |
| **Code Suggestion**   | Suggesting code improvements or additions | Provides recommendations for improving or extending code | Instruction-based    | Relevance, feasibility, effectiveness, BLEU | **Instruction-Based (ShareGPT)**: <br> **Prompt**: "Suggest improvements for this Python code: `def multiply(a, b): return a * b`." <br> **Response**: "You might want to add error handling to ensure both arguments are numbers." | **Pretrain-Based (Alpaca)**: <br> **Prompt**: "Suggest improvements for this function: `def multiply(a, b): return a * b`." <br> **Completion**: "Consider adding type checks to handle cases where `a` and `b` are not numbers."           |

### Notes:
- **Instruction-Based (ShareGPT)**: Data specifically created to address certain tasks or queries with direct answers or explanations. Examples are designed to directly respond to the provided instructions.
- **Pretrain-Based (Alpaca)**: Uses general text data the model has been trained on to generate responses. Examples reflect the model's broad knowledge acquired during pretraining.

### Evaluation Methods:
- **BLEU**: Measures the overlap of n-grams between generated text and reference text, often used for evaluating translation and summarization.
- **BERTScore**: Uses BERT embeddings to evaluate the quality of generated text based on semantic similarity to reference text.
- **ROUGE**: Measures the overlap of n-grams between generated text and reference text, commonly used in summarization and text generation tasks.

This table provides a comprehensive overview of how different types of datasets and evaluation methods apply to various features of LLMs.
