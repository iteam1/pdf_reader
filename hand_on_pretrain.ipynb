      "To the apparent surprise of everyone, the Walt Disney Company has agreed to fork over $4.05 billion in cash and stock for George Lucasâ€™ studio in a deal that brings together two of the worldâ€™s most important intellectual property libraries. As you might expect, Disney is itching to take advantage of its new toys. Under the terms of this agreement Disney will acquire control over all Lucasfilm iterations. This includes both its traditional film-making studio facilities as well as the various technologies Lucasfilm has created over the years to further its various media properties. Thus, the gigantic Disney family now includes Lucasfilm itself, special effects house Industrial Light & Magic, Skywalker Sound and LucasArts, the companyâ€™s video game creation division. This acquisition alone would be huge news, but as if to pre-empt fan speculation on the future of Star Wars, a new Star Wars movie is scheduled to appear in 2015. Though the vast majority of recent Star Wars media has been focused on the propertyâ€™s various animated iterations and LEGO crossovers, this new film will be the first official cinematic continuation of George Lucasâ€™ original Star Wars trilogy.</s>\n",
